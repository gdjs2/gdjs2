### Hi there 👋

This is gdjs2, Zhaoqi Xiao, 肖兆祺.

I am currently a Ph.D. student👨‍🎓 in computer science at University of California, Riverside (UCR).

Before joining UCR, I obtained B.Eng.🎓 in computer science from Southern University of Science and Technology in July, 2022.

My research interests focus on computer security, especially dynamic/static program analysis based on software or hardware techniques.
